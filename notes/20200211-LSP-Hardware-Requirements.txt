# Hardware Specification for deploying LSP on a Kubernetes cluster on Openstack

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following roughly describes an outline of the hardware specifications required to setup a deployment of the LSP on Openstack


#-----------------#
# Number of Nodes #
#-----------------#

At least 3 nodes
   1 Master node
   2 Worker nodes


#-----#
# CPU #
#-----#

At least 2, but ideally 4 VCores


#----------#
# Storage  #
#----------#

At least 100GB, ideally 200GB volume storage

The LSP stack includes a "fileserver" service which is a "A simple NFSv4 fileserver that provides shared storage for home directories and data".
For distributed storage we could experiment with that (not working at the moment), or setup our own NFS server.

#-----#
# RAM #
#-----#

No specific requirements, but 2GB or more per node should suffice



#------------#
# Networking #
#----------- #

Public IPs:
   At least 1 Public IP, ideally 2 or more (1 per service)
   If we have one public IP, we can create a Gateway Apache proxy node with a public IP, and setup reverse proxies to the different services 
   (http://public_ip/nublado, http://public_ip/tap, http://public_ip/firefly ..)

Networking considerations:
   All worker & master nodes need to be on the same private network, to be able to access each other
	


#-----------------------------------------#
# Virtualization & Application Deployment #
#---------------------------------------- #

All of the LSP applications and required services will be setup as containers using Kubernetes, and Helm charts


#------------------#
# Operating System #
#------------------#

Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic)
 (Not a requirement, but development work has being done on this)
