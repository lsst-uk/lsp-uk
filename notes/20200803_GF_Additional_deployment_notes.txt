Some additional notes from deploying the LSP at RAL

1) Storageclass

The helm charts attempt to create and use their own default K8s storageclass. This may produce odd results if a default storageclass already exists.
The storageclass is defined in helm/charts/fileserver/templates/storageclass.yml and may require modification for the specific cloud, e.g. changing the az name.

2) OAuth Callback URL

I had to change this from http to https to work with my proxy setup. The OAuth callback URL is set in helm/charts/nublado/templates/jupyterhub/secrets.template.yml
